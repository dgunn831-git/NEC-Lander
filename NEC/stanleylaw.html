While the types of matters vary, we know that each of our clients has a story to tell. Our lawyers and staff work to give a voice to those stories.  To do this, we listen to you and then use all our skills to fight for your rights.

                            <h3>Michael Stanley</h3>
                            <p>Michael Stanley was born in California and grew up in Texas.  He went to college in New Mexico and got a law degree from New York University School of Law.  He returned to Texas in 1990 to begin his legal career.</p>
                            <p>Over more than thirty years, Michael has represented individuals, small and large corporations, and even a foreign government.  He often finds himself fighting for the victims of negligence, bad products and fraud.  He has sought justice for the death of a premature baby that received improper treatment, victims of nursing home abuse, a soldier whose helicopter crashed due to a defective part, hundreds of elderly investors that were swindled out of their life savings, a mother injured during childbirth, farmers and others exposed to harmful chemicals, and victims with PTSD from traumatic injuries.  He has taken on large insurance companies for bad faith in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike and sued multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical companies on behalf of a small start-up company.  Michael is best motivated when asked to serve the underdog whose legal rights have been violated.</p>
                            <p>He and his wife have raised three children who live throughout Texas.  He enjoys visiting and traveling with his family.</p>
