                            <h3>SECTION 1 – A BIG Problem</h3>
                            <p>Recently, the news broke that baby formula products are being linked to serious gastrointestinal problems in infants.  Specifically, studies have revealed that popular baby formulas, Similac and Enfamil, may be extremely harmful for premature and newborn babies and even directly responsible for what is called ‘necrotizing enterocolitis' or NEC</p>
                            <p>Worse, according to documents filed in the lawsuits that have followed, the manufacturers of these baby formulas, Abbot Laboratories and Mead Johnson & Company, LLC, allegedly knew about the risks posed by their products and did nothing to address this issue.  Instead, they continued to sell their products without warning the public of the potential risks.  And these companies are now lawyering-up to deny any accountability, responsibility, or liability for their actions.</p>
                            <p>Michael Stanley, a top lawyer leading the legal response to this tragedy, is vowing to hold these companies accountable for the harmful practices.</p>
                            <p>(Stanley) "Our job is to make sure all parents, whose children have been injured and may be suffering today directly from this negligence, have a voice, are represented. and most importantly, have real and effective legal options.  Whether that fight is for justice and to help make sure these bad practices stop forever, or to get compensation or other type of legal remedy"</p>
                            <h3>SECTION 2 – What You Can Do</h3>
                            <p>Parents of ANY children harmed by these milk-based baby formulas are encouraged to get involved NOW.</p>
                            <p>(Stanley) "We understand that this has been extremely hard and it is always difficult for anyone to have to watch their own children suffer, but we are moving forward and creating legal remedies."</p>
                            <p>The first thing to do is learn about what happened and what can be done to help your family.  Then, we recommend you sign-up with us to protect your legal rights.  We've prepared several videos about what really happened here, the formulas and companies involved, about the litigation as a whole, how things work, as well as about the law firms and the lawyers here at MSL.  We've assembled this online system for you to get started and take charge – and encourage you to learn as much as you can.   More importantly, we are here to help answer any and all questions you have.</p>
                            <p>(Stanley) "An informed client is the best client there is – signing up and talking to us is the first step in that process"</p>
                            <h3>SECTION 3 – Taking Action</h3>

                            <p>(Stanley) "And we never forget who we work for – at Stanley Law, you're in charge"
                            <p>CLOSE - (Stanley/Talent) "We are fighting to make sure that all those who have suffered as a result of these dangerous products get the recovery that their children deserve."</p>
