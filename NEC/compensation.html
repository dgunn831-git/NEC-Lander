                        <div class="lower-content">
                            <p>Michael Stanley and lawyers at Stanley Law are actively seeking Similac and Enfamil (NEC) lawsuits from parents of premature infants who were fed with Similac, Enfamil (or another cow milk-based formula) and subsequently developed NEC.</p>
                            <p>NEC is considered a mass torts law suit which are are typically made up of individual lawsuits against one or a group of the same defendants. The plaintiffs, who all have their own lawsuits, claim that the same defendant(s) caused all of them harm through the same or very similar circumstances.</p>
                            <p>In the NEC case, no individual is required to participate in the settlement. Instead, a settlement is structured such that each individual's case facts are evaluated on its own merits, including exposure, causation, injuries, and damages.  <u>Remember, you are in charge and you lawyers (and their law firm) works for you and on your behalf!    For example, if you receive an offer, you do NOT have to take it.   Tell your lawyer it is too low and if you have to, he will go to trail on your behalf.  You may end up with a higher settlement number.  But, remember,  you may lose if court and end up with a lower offer.</u></p>
                            <p>NEC, like most mass tort cases will likely be disposed through some form of settlement, with less than 3 percent of all tort matters resulting in an actual trial.  Litigants have strong incentives to save on litigation costs by settling out of court.</p>
                            <h3>Does this cost anything?</h3>
                            <p>The Legal Assist Group is paid by the Law Firm and does NOT charge you, the claimant, for anything. A law firm will submit a claim on your behalf and will fight to get you the largest cash settlement possible. The law firm will only be paid if there is a settlement on your behalf and then only a set % of the recovery.</p>
